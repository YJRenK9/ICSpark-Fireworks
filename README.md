# ICSpark Fireworks
Creative coding project that launches fireworks to celebrate ICSpark's Anniversary.  Besides the theme being ICSpark, it's also whatever the mentor and students like these days.  Feel free to let me know if you have any more ideas for this project :)

Should work on Smartphones and Computers.

Controls:
- launch a firework (left mouse click)
- toggle Roy G. Biv mode (r)
- show/hide motto (m)
- toggle auto mode (a)
- Add another auto firework instance (shift + a)

- ASCII title 
- option to display fireworks as words instead of ASCII characters 
- ASCII rocket ship
- ASCII planet
- ASCII shark
- ASCII Pokemon
- Minecraft characters
- Minecraft items as firework projectiles
- Mini game where the player shoots enemies with fireworks
- More CCM, CADRE, and SIGGRAPH references
